# Diagraph-Visualization
Diagraph Visulization is a visualization tool for backpropagation and arithmetic expressions using Graphviz.
Capable of showing arithmetic expressions done to variables as a flowchart, it was created for the explicit purpose of making it easier to explain backpropagation.

Use the Value class to initialize all variables.Said class supports the 5 basic built-in arithmetic operators:
<ul>
  <li>Addition (+)</li>
  <li>Subtraction (-)</li>
  <li>Multiplication (*)</li>
  <li>Floor Division (//)</li>
  <li>True Division (/)</li>
  <li>Power (**)</li>
</ul>
